# PS1 Graphics

Just a tiny little OpenGL thing where I'm trying to replicate the PS1's
graphics, within reason. This is mostly just to I can make some cool-looking
retro games in the future, but I guess we'll see where this goes.

So far I have implemented:
* Downsampling
* Bayer 4x4 dithering
* Polygon jittering
* Colorspace compression (16 bit, aided by dithering)
* Affine texture mapping
